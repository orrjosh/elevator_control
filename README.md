## Questions

- How long did you spend on this?

About 3 hours(got hung up with readline for a while)

- What, if anything, would you change if you had more time to spend on it?

Obviously a gui.

Add some more unit tests around validators.

Make both validation error messages show on double input error. Currently it shows the selected floor message only if both are invalid.

Interrupt for pressing buttons on higher floors(pushing down button on a floor while elevator moving).

- (Optional) What you would change if anything about this challenge? Anything else you want to share with us?

It's a good challenge for teasing out ability to handle ambiguity. I can't really think of any changes.
